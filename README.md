# go-mvcc

Attempt to better understand isolation levels by working through [@eatonphil's](https://github.com/eatonphil) MVCC blog post. The code has been originally written by @eatonphil and I'm typing it out instead of just reading through it for better understanding. And as I progress, I'm marking `TODO` and adding my own commentary to further my understanding.
